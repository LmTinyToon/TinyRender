# TinyRender
It is my attemp to create own small render (for educational purposes) on C++ lanugage. 
I am planning to implement basic algorithms of computer graphics in this project.

NOTE: I am developing this project on Windows platform.
	  In current version of render I am using TGA format of file to produce result image.
	  Brief specification of TGA format is located here: 
	  1) https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Truevision_TGA
