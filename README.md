# TinyRender
It is my attemp to create own small render (for educational purposes) on C++ lanugage. 
I am planning to implement basic algorithms of computer graphics in this project.

In current version of renderer I am using TGA format of file to produce result image.
Current version of renderer supports simple operations on TGA images (such as create image, change pixels of image, save image).
Brief specification of TGA format is located here: 

1) https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Truevision_TGA

2) http://www.paulbourke.net/dataformats/tga/

Initial format of loaded models is wavefront obj file. Brief exploration of this one can be found here:

NOTE: I am developing this project on platform Window. MCSV project is stored in repository.

My implementation of TinyRender is partially based on https://github.com/ssloy/tinyrenderer 

Author of that project has really good course on Russian language at https://habrahabr.ru/post/248153/.
