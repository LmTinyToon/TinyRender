# TinyRender
TinyRender is  small renderer written mainly in educational purposes on C++ language. Current implementation is supported 
on Windows, Linux operation systems.

In current version of renderer I am using TGA format of file to produce result image.
Current version of renderer supports simple operations on TGA images (such as create image, change pixels of image, save image).
Brief specification of TGA format is located here: 

1) https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Truevision_TGA

2) http://www.paulbourke.net/dataformats/tga/

Initial format of loaded models is wavefront obj file. Brief exploration of this one can be found here:

NOTE: My implementation of TinyRender is inspired by https://github.com/ssloy/tinyrenderer.
